			<h2>Defeat</h2>
			<p>Defeat, my Defeat, my solitude and my aloofness;<br/> You are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs,<br/> And sweeter to my heart than all world-glory.<br/></p>
			<p>Defeat, my Defeat, my self-knowledge and my defiance,<br/> Through you I know that I am yet young and swift of foot<br/> And not to be trapped by withering laurels.<br/> And in you I have found aloneness<br/> And the joy of being shunned and scorned.<br/></p>
			<p>Defeat, my Defeat, my shining sword and shield,<br/> In your eyes I have read<br/> That to be enthroned is to be enslaved,<br/> And to be understood is to be leveled down,<br/> And to be grasped is but to reach oneâ€™s fullness<br/> And like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed.<br/></p>
			<p>Defeat, my Defeat, my bold companion,<br/> You shall hear my songs and my cries and my silences,<br/> And none but you shall speak to me of the beating of wings,<br/> And urging of seas,<br/> And of mountains that burn in the night,<br/> And you alone shall climb my steep and rocky soul.<br/></p>
			<p>Defeat, my Defeat, my deathless courage,<br/> You and I shall laugh together with the storm,<br/> And together we shall dig graves for all that die in us,<br/> And we shall stand in the sun with a will,<br/> And we shall be dangerous.<br/></p>
